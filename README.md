Credit Card Fraud Kaggle

Credit card fraud is a serious problem in today's digital world. With the increasing use of credit cards and the ease with which they can be used to make purchases, there is a greater risk for fraud.
The dataset that I used was found on Kaggle and is called Credit Card Fraud Detection. Simply, the dataset shows data from fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
The data itself has features that already are processed PCA transformations. And due to confidentiality, each of the headers of the features is named V1 â€” V29. Only Amount, which describes the amount transacted, and Time, describing the time taken for a transaction to complete are non-anonymous. Additionally, there is a Class label that is one-hot encoded to indicate non-fraudulent (0), and fraudulent (1), which indicates that this is a binary classification dataset.
